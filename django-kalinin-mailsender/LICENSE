Create a django-polls/LICENSE file. Choosing a license is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but suffice it to say that code released publicly without a license is useless. Django and many Django-compatible apps are distributed under the BSD license; however, youâ€™re free to pick your own license. Just be aware that your licensing choice will affect who is able to use your code.
